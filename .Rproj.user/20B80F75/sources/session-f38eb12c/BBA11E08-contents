## Section 1: Description of the data

I am using the dataset called **Candy Power Ranking** from [Five Thirty Eightâ€™s GitHub data repository](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/candy-power-ranking).

This is data collected from an online survey that pitted Halloween candy types in head-to-head battles. Ultimately, 8,371 different IP addresses voted on roughly 269,000 randomly generated match-ups.

It is a flat file and is a comma-separated value (CSV) delimited file.

## Section 2: Reading the data into R


1. Load data with read_csv function, which is from the readr package.


```{r load_data}
library(readr)

get_candy <- paste0("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight",
                      "/data/master/candy-power-ranking/candy-data.csv")
candy <- read_csv(get_candy)
```
2. Clean up data by making column names more readable and filtering to rows that include only chocolate candy (the one I am most interested in).


```{r clean_data}
library(dplyr)

candy <- candy %>% 
  rename(candy = competitorname,
         peanuty_almondy = peanutyalmondy, 
         crisped_rice_wafer = crispedricewafer, 
         sugar_percent = sugarpercent,
         price_percent = pricepercent,
         win_percent = winpercent) %>% 
  filter(chocolate == "1")
```


## Section 3: Characteristics of the data


1. There are `r nrow(candy)` rows and `r ncol(candy)` columns in the filtered candy data set that includes only chocolate candy.

```{r kable_table}
library(knitr)

my.df <- data.frame(Column_Name = c("candy", "chocolate", "fruity",  "caramel",
                               "peanut_almondy", "nougat", "crisped_rice_wafer",
                               "hard", "bar", "pluribus", "sugar_percent",
                               "price_percent", "win_percent"),
                    Description = c("Name of candy", 
                                    "Does it contain chocolate?",
                                    "Is it fruit flavored?",
                                    "Is there caramel in the candy?",
                                    "Does it contain peanuts or almonds",
                                    "Does it contain nougat?",
                                    "Does it contain crisped rice or wafers?",
                                    "Is it a hard candy?",
                                    "Is it a candy bar?",
                                    "Is it one of many candies in unit?",
                                    "The percentile of sugar.",
                                    "The unit price percentile.",
                                    "The overall win percentage."),
                    Unit = c("N/a", "True (1) or False (0)",
                             "True (1) or False (0)",
                             "True (1) or False (0)",
                             "True (1) or False (0)",
                             "True (1) or False (0)",
                             "True (1) or False (0)",
                             "True (1) or False (0)",
                             "True (1) or False (0)",
                             "True (1) or False (0)",
                             "Percent", "Percent", "Percent"))


kable(my.df, digits = 2, align = c("r", "c"),
      caption = "Candy set data")
```


## Section 4: Summary statistics


1. Summary of sugar percent (the percentile of sugar it falls 
under within the data set).


```{r sugar_percent}
sugar <- candy %>%
  summarize(count_na = sum(is.na(sugar_percent)),
            min_sugar = min(sugar_percent),
            max_sugar = max(sugar_percent), 
            mean_sugar = mean(sugar_percent))

sugar
```


2. Summary of price percent (the unit price percentile 
compared to the rest of the set).


```{r price_percent}
price <- candy %>%
  summarize(count_na = sum(is.na(price_percent)),
            min_price = min(price_percent),
            max_price = max(price_percent), 
            mean_price = mean(price_percent))

price
```

3. Summary of win percent (the overall win percentage according 
to 269,000 matchups).


```{r wins}
wins <- candy %>%
  summarize(count_na = sum(is.na(win_percent)),
            min_wins = min(win_percent),
            max_wins = max(win_percent), 
            mean_wins = mean(win_percent))

wins
```


## Section 5: Visualizing the data


1. The histogram gives me an idea of how much relative sugar content chocolate
candy has. This plot shows that there is a cluster of chocolate candy around the 25th percentile and the 60th percentile, which is lower than I would have 
thought. This plot uses clear labels and I decreased the data density at least
a little bit by using a minimalist theme.

```{r, fig.width=4, fig.height=2, histogram}
library(ggplot2)
library(ggthemes)

ggplot(candy, aes(x = sugar_percent)) + 
  geom_histogram(bins=20, fill = "chocolate", color = "black") + 
  ggtitle("      Relative Sugar Content 
          in Chocolate Candy") + 
  xlab("Sugar Percentile") +
  theme_few()
```


2. This scatter plot shows the relationship between the relative cost of the 
candy and how often the candy won in the head-to-head battles. This reveals
any relationships- for example, if more expensive candy is more likely to win.
This actually showed that the candy with the best chances at winning was around
the 65th percentile in price point. This plot uses clear labels, a minimalist
theme, shows a reference with a fitted curve, and highlighted the 
65th percentile.


```{r, fig.height=2.5}
ggplot(candy, aes(x=price_percent, y=win_percent))+
  geom_vline(xintercept=0.652)+
  geom_point(size=2)+
  theme_few()+
  geom_smooth()+
  ggtitle("Price vs Chances of Chocolate Candy Winning") + 
  xlab("Relative Price (%)") +
  ylab("Relative Amount of Wins (%)")
```
